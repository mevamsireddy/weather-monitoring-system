# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is a real-time weather monitoring system that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for Indian metropolitan cities and logs the temperature and weather conditions at regular intervals. It includes functionalities to alert users based on temperature thresholds and save daily summaries to a SQLite database.

## Features
- Fetches current weather data for specified cities.
- Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Logs temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Alerts users based on temperature thresholds.
- Stores daily weather summaries in a SQLite database.
- Comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.

```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mevamsireddy/weather-monitoring-system.git
   cd weather_monitoring
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv weather_env
weather_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the SQLite database:
The application will initialize the SQLite database automatically when it runs, but you need to ensure that the data directory exists. You can create it manually if it does not exist:
```bash
mkdir data
```

5. API Key: Replace the placeholder for the OpenWeatherMap API key in the weather_fetcher.py file to run the application:
```python
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
```

## Dependencies
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Python: 3.10
- Packages:
-- requests - for making API calls
-- unittest - for testing (included with Python standard library)
-- sqlite3 - for database operations (included with Python standard library)

## Design Choices
* Architecture: The system is built using a modular approach, with separate scripts for fetching weather data, converting temperatures, saving summaries, and checking alerts.
* Database: SQLite is chosen for simplicity and ease of use, allowing for lightweight data storage without the need for a separate database server.
* Testing: Comprehensive unit tests are included using the unittest framework to ensure the functionality of each module.
* API Integration: The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch weather data, providing a reliable source of real-time weather information.

## Usage
1. Run the Weather Fetcher:
The main application can be started using the following command:
```bash
python scripts/weather_fetcher.py
```
The application will run indefinitely, fetching weather data at regular intervals (default is set to 5 minute).

2. Temperature Alerts:
Alerts are triggered based on defined temperature thresholds. You can modify these thresholds in the check_alert function within the weather_fetcher.py script.

3. Daily Summary:
The application automatically saves daily summaries in the SQLite database located at data/weather_data.db.

4. Weather Visualizer:
You can use the weather_visualizer.py script to visualize the logged weather data. When run, this script will generate visual representations of the weather data stored in the SQLite database.

## Example Output:
The output generated by weather_visualizer.py includes graphs of daily temperature, humidity, and other weather parameters. The output files may include images like temperature_plot.png, humidity_plot.png, etc.
```bash
python scripts/weather_visualizer.py
```

## Testing
To run the unit tests for the application, use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
This command will execute all the tests defined in the tests directory.
